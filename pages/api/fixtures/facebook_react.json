PR makes two changes (as separate commits):</p>\n<h3>Make the <code>enableSchedulingProfiler</code> flag dynamic for Facebook builds</h3>\n<p>The dynamic flag allows us to avoid logging User Timing marks for users who happen to be running the profiling build of React on Facebook. These users aren't going to be using our scheduling profiler, and there's some evidence that the overhead this adds is not trivial for at least Firefox.</p>\n<h3>Update the scheduling profiler feature check to require User Timing level 3</h3>\n<p>Browsers that implement User Timing level 2 (e.g. Firefox) apparently struggle to keep up with the number of marks the scheduling profiler is logging. To avoid this, the feature detection has been updated to require User Timing level 3 support. In addition to this, marks are cleared immediately after being logged to avoid perpetually growing the entries buffer.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"issue-keyword tooltipped tooltipped-se\" aria-label=\"This pull request closes pull request #20215.\">Resolves</span> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"740250304\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20215\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/facebook/react/pull/20215/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20215\">#20215</a></p>","createdAt":"2020-11-10T21:20:05Z","deletions":77,"merged":false,"mergedAt":null,"number":20215,"state":"OPEN","title":"Scheduling profiler tweaks","url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20215","comments":{"totalCount":4},"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"THUMBS_DOWN","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"LAUGH","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"CONFUSED","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":0}}],"author":{"login":"bvaughn","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/29597?u=554447abec36b3c4f8cf21f754e3b200ad383f24&v=4","url":"https://github.com/bvaughn","__typename":"User"}}},{"cursor":"Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOHuuEGg==","node":{"additions":1,"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","bodyHTML":"<p>We defined 2 times <code>setExtraStackFrame</code> and I think it's redundant so I removed :)</p>","createdAt":"2020-11-10T20:39:01Z","deletions":5,"merged":false,"mergedAt":null,"number":20214,"state":"OPEN","title":"style: remove redundant defination","url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20214","comments":{"totalCount":3},"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"THUMBS_DOWN","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"LAUGH","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"CONFUSED","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":0}},{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":0}}],"author":{"login":"behnammodi","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1549069?u=a6cac0758a62eaf8023c1d6ce112385e1413f7a6&v=4","url":"https://github.com/behnammodi","__typename":"User"}}},{"cursor":"Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOHupXWg==","node":{"additions":10,"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","bodyHTML":"<p>In the commit phase, we should be able to assume that the <code>return</code> pointers in the just-completed tree are consistent.
