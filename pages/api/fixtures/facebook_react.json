a bunch of no-inline directives to commit phase functions to prevent them from being inlined into one of our recursive algorithms.</p>\n<p>The motivation is to minimize the number of variables in the recursive functions, since each one contributes to the size of the stack frame.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, this could help the performance of both the recursive and non-recursive (iterative) implementations of the commit phase, since even the iterative implementation sometimes uses the JS
