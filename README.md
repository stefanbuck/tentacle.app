## What is tentacle.app?

Staying on top of issues and pull requests is a great way to follow the evolution of a project. However, it can be difficult to keep track of all the changes and discussion especially when the project is moving fast.

If you subscribe to a project, you will receive notifications of new issues and pull requests, as well as any comments that are made. However, the amount of information you see in your notifications inbox is limited. if you want to see more information beyond title, author, and date, you have to open every issue and pull request in your browser. Wouldn&apos;t it be nice if you could just scroll through the list as you do on Twitter?

Meet [tentacle.app](https://tentacle.app), a web app that allows you to consume updates much faster. Define your search query, and you will receive a list of all issues and pull requests that match your query. The Tentacle project does not aim to replace the GitHub notification center. In fact, it does not use any GitHub notification information at all. That way your GitHub inbox remains reserved for your personal notification.
